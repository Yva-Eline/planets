dry
cold
everything is my fav color
the two moons may be an issue for wolfman
maybe I should start with a base on Venus 
What about mummy? Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
Mummy might like the cold dry climate
I wonder where we will put the HAB
Who else should we invite to the Mars Monster Mash?
Consider Venus as a base
